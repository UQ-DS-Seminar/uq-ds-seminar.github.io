Graph structures are prevalent across a variety of fields, including social networks, e-commerce, transportation, and biological systems. Within these graphs, numerous analytical and mining tasks can be identified, often aligning with link prediction, node classification, or graph classification. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in these applications, primarily due to their capability to learn powerful graph representations. Nevertheless, the efficacy of GNNs often depends on the availability of labeled data, without which their performance may be compromised. This talk seeks to delve into learning paradigms that diverge from traditional supervised learning, in the context of few-shot learning on graphs. In particular, drawing inspiration from recent progress in language modeling, we pose an intriguing question: Can prompt-based learning be effectively adapted for graph data? Our talk will begin with a comprehensive overview of few-shot learning methodologies on graphs, followed by highlighting some of our representative works in this area.
