While LLMs offer powerful reasoning and generalization capabilities for user understanding and long-term planning in recommendation systems, their latency and cost hinder direct application in large-scale industrial settings. The talk will cover our recent work on scalable hybrid approaches that combine LLMs and traditional recommendation models. We'll explore their effectiveness in tackling challenges like cold-start recommendations and enhancing user exploration.
