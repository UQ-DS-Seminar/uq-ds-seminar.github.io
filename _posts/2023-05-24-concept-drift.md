Real-time decision-making for streaming data is facing a common but challenging problem, concept drift. Namely, the data distribution changes over time. Classic machine learning schema might be invalid to obtain reliable prediction results for data streams that have the concept drift problem. This talk presents three solutions to address this issue. In addition, concept drift is discussed when it co-exists with temporal dependence in a data stream. In the end, this talk will drop a view on the future study of concept drift adaptation methodologies that facilitate reliable learning for multiple streams that are neither independent nor identically distributed.
