Complex event processing emerged as a computational paradigm to detect patterns in event streams based on the continuous evaluation of event queries. Once such queries are evaluated in a network of event sources, efficient query evaluation may be achieved through the distributed evaluation of queries. In this talk, we present some of our recent results on achieving such distribution with the model of MuSE graphs as well as optimizations that rely on push-pull-communication.
