Most existing few-shot classification methods only consider generalization on one dataset (i.e., single-domain), failing to transfer across various seen and unseen domains. 
In this talk, I will introduce the more realistic multi-domain few-shot classification problem to investigate the cross-domain generalization. Specifically, I will elaborate our ICCV 2021 work which designed a  parameter-efficient multi-mode modulator (tri-M) to solve the above problem. First, the modulator is designed to maintain multiple modulation parameters (one for each domain) in a single network, thus achieving single-network multi-domain representation. Given a particular domain, domain-aware features can be efficiently generated with the well-devised separative selection and cooperative query modules. Second, we further divide the modulation parameters into the domain-specific set and the domain-cooperative set to explore the intra-domain information and inter-domain correlations, respectively. We demonstrate that the proposed multi-mode modulator achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging META-DATASET benchmark, especially for unseen test domains.
