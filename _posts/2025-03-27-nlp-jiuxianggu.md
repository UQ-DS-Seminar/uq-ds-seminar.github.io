Multimodal intelligence is revolutionizing document understanding by enabling AI to process and reason across vision and language. This talk explores how large-scale models integrate textual and visual information to enhance document analysis, addressing key challenges such as multimodal fusion, layout-aware learning, and post-training optimization. We discuss strategies to improve model adaptability, including contrastive learning and retrieval-augmented fine-tuning. Finally, we highlight future directions in cross-modal reasoning and scalable architectures, aiming to advance automation and knowledge extraction in AI-driven document intelligence.
