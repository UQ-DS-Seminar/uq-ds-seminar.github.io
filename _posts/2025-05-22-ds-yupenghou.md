The emergence of large generative models is transforming the landscape of recommender systems, offering new opportunities through scaling laws and flexible content generation. One of the most fundamental components is action tokenization, which is the process of converting human-readable data (e.g., text or user-item interactions) into model-readable token sequences. This talk provides a tokenization-centric view of building effective and efficient generative recommendation models. We begin by introducing the backgrounds of semantic IDs and action tokenization techniques, as covered in our WWW’25 tutorial. We then introduce two recent work: aligning action tokens with LLMs (ICDE’24) and contextually tokenizing action sequences (ICML’25 spotlight).
