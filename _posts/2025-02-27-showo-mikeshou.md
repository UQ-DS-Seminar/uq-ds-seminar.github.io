Exciting models have been developed in multimodal video understanding and generation, such as video LLM and video diffusion model. One emerging pathway to the ultimate intelligence is to create one single foundation model that can do both understanding and generation. After all, humans only use one brain to do both tasks. Towards such unification, recent attempts employ a base language model for multimodal understanding but require an additional pre-trained diffusion model for visual generation, which still remain as two separate components. In this work, we present Show-o, one single transformer that handles both multimodal understanding and generation. Unlike fully autoregressive models, Show-o is the first to unify autoregressive and discrete diffusion modeling, flexibly supporting a wide range of vision-language tasks including visual question-answering, text-to-image generation, text-guided inpainting/extrapolation, and mixed-modality generation of any input/output format, all within one single 1.3B transformer. Across various benchmarks, Show-o demonstrates comparable or superior performance, shedding light for building the next-generation video foundation model.
