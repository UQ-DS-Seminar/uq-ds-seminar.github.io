Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is vital for ensuring the safety and reliability of artificial intelligence systems. It represents a novel and trending area in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The concept of OOD detection was first proposed in 2017 and has since shown significant potential in enabling the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world applications, including medical safety and autonomous driving system. Over the past few years, a rich line of algorithms has been developed to address the generalized OOD detection problem empirically. In this talk, we will present the latest advancements in OOD detection theory, and OOD detection algorithms.
