Novel view synthesis (NVS) from 2D images aims to generate unseen views of a scene given multiple input observations. It is a fundamental task in computer vision that has garnered significant attention due to recent advances in 3D representations and neural rendering. Techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting have substantially improved NVS quality, yet the demand for more efficient approaches—in terms of space, time, and storage—remains a critical research direction. In this talk, I will present our recent efforts to address these challenges. Specifically, I will discuss two of our latest works: FCGS (ICLR 2025), which introduces a compression method for 3D Gaussian Splatting, and Pansplat (CVPR 2025), a feed-forward model designed for panoramic novel view synthesis.
