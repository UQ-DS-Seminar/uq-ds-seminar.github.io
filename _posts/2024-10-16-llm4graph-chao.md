Graph data structures play a crucial role in real life, effectively illustrating the complex relationships and structural dependencies between entities. In recent years, the generalization capabilities of graph models have garnered significant attention. We can't help but wonder about the possibilities that could emerge if we fully leveraged large models to address these challenges. This is the central focus of our research: developing large language models and foundational models specifically tailored for graph data. Our strategy involves designing LLMs that can effectively encode and reason about graph structures, capturing the intricate relationships among entities. By applying the principles of language models to the domain of graph data, we aim to deepen our understanding of graph structures, ultimately achieving more powerful and scalable graph analysis to tackle real-world challenges in learning data relationships.
