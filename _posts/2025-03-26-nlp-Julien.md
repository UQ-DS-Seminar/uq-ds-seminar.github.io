In this talk, we present some of our recent work conducted at Amazon International Machine Learning Australia. First, we present a simple approach to address cold-start recommendation by leveraging semantic information (ACM Recsys ’24). We then introduce a notion of generalization gap in collaborative filtering, and derive a geometric upper bound and a way to meaningfully utilize the geometry of the product metadata to improve recommendations (AISTATS ’25).  We finally present an application of sequential recommendation for complementary product selection (ACM WSDM ’25).
