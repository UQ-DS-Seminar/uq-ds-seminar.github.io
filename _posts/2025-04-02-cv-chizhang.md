In recent years, the development of multimodal large language models has given rise to a new class of intelligent agents—GUI Agents—that can autonomously operate computers and smartphones through natural language, enabling automated office tasks and cross-application task execution. However, existing methods rely on step-by-step reasoning, resulting in high computational costs and low execution efficiency, especially for repetitive tasks.

To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce AppAgent X, an evolutionary GUI agent framework. Unlike traditional agents that repeatedly reason through each step, AppAgent X learns from its own operational experience, continuously generalizing and optimizing efficient behavior patterns. This enables the agent to become more efficient and intelligent with use.

This presentation will cover the core mechanisms of AppAgent X, experimental results, and its potential applications in the field of intelligent agents.
