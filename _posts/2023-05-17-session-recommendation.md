In recent years, sequential/session-based recommendations have emerged as a new recommendation paradigm to well model usersâ€™ dynamic and short-term preferences for more accurate and timely recommendations. They have been employed in various application domains, including e-Commerce, video platforms/apps, news websites/apps, etc. and have achieved great success. In this talk, I will briefly share some of our work in this vibrant research area. First, I will introduce the background, and research problem of sequential/session-based recommendation. Then, I will introduce three specific sub-areas in this area (i.e., next-product recommendation, next-basket recommendation, next-news recommendation) via sharing some of our specific work in each of them, followed by an overview of some applications of sequential/session-based recommendations. Finally, I will conclude this talk by sharing some future directions.
