Generative models show great potential in generating new samples, which have been extensively investigated in 2D/3D vision tasks. Among them, the adversarial training based models, e.g. Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN), are proven more effective in sample quality, compared with those likelihood based models, e.g. Variational Auto-encoders (VAE), Normalizing Flow (NF), etc. However, GANs show limitation in density modelling or stable -training, making it unsuitable for those likelihood-based tasks, e.g. out-of-distribution detection. Recently, score-based diffusion models are studied, and related research explains its superiority in both sample quality and density modelling. In this task, we will explain the basic idea of score-based diffusion models, and explore its potential in 2D/3D vision tasks.
