Censoring is the central problem in survival analysis where either the time-to-event (for instance, death) or the time-to-censoring (such as loss of follow-up) is observed for each sample. The majority of existing survival analysis methods assume that survival is conditionally independent of censoring given a set of covariates, an assumption that cannot be verified since only marginal distributions are available from the data. The existence of dependent censoring and the inherent bias in current estimators has been demonstrated in various applications, accentuating the need for a more nuanced approach. However, existing methods that adjust for dependent censoring require practitioners to specify the ground truth copula. This requirement poses a significant challenge for practical applications, as model misspecification can lead to substantial bias. This talk will discuss a flexible survival analysis method that simultaneously accommodates dependent censoring and eliminates the requirement for specifying the copula. We theoretically prove the identifiability of our model under a broad family of copulas and survival distributions and empirically demonstrate that our method achieves significantly lower estimation bias when compared to existing approaches.
