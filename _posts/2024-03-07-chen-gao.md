Recommender system has reshaped how we access information in today's world, make relevant content more accessible to everyone. However, it has also resulted in some negative side-effects, such as the filter bubble. The filter bubble refers to the phenenomon that the content the user is exposed to becomes more and more homogeneous and limited, causing increased bias and polarization. In this talk, we first discuss one of the most important aspects of the filter bubble, recommendation diversity, particularly diversified recommendation models and full-stage large-scale online experiments on short-video platforms. Then, we will present the quantitive analysis of the filter bubble on one of the largest short-video platforms, introducing a novel concept: deep filter bubble. Last, we will present a general and easy-to-use framework of controllable recommender system to break out of the filter bubble.
