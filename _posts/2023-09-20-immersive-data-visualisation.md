In recent years, significant advances in extended reality (XR) and AI have offered novel, promising ways to visualise and eventually better understand large and complex data. Immersion augments our ability to visualise data beyond the 2D screen, offers more display space and more direct interaction with the data. AI can perform, for example, advanced tasks such as exploratory data analysis, or sophisticated classification and segmentation of data. How do these two technologies merge to better inform human-in-the-loop approaches to support data-related tasks? In this talk I will first briefly introduce my previous work in Immersive Analytics, which includes the visualisation of abstract and 3D data in multiple XR scenarios. I will then present my recent work on immersive and interactive 3D point cloud classification through a dialogue with a machine learning model in Virtual Reality, to support a classification task.
