Language models are systems that can predict upcoming words" - this classical definition of NLP models forms the basis of LLMs becoming responsive text completion models. However, such "responsive" capability is not good enough for LLMs to serve as "compliant AI assistants". This talk will address the gap between current LLMs and "compliant AI assistants" that limits the broad real-world applications of LLMs. The speaker will introduce a systematic research path to develop trustworthy LLMs as compliant AI assistants. The talk will mainly cover the speaker's research on controllable generation, context faithfulness, and safety of LLMs. The research methodology will cover advanced techniques in training, data synthesis, prompt engineering, decoding, and meta-generation that comprehensively develop trustworthy LLM-based AI systems.
