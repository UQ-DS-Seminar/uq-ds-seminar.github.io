Segmentation and detection are two fundamental and classical tasks in computer vision. In recent years, significant attention has been devoted to the open-vocabulary object segmentation and detection, aiming to generalize beyond the limited number of classes labeled during training and segment or detect objects described by arbitrary category names at inference. Compared with conventional ones, open vocabulary object segmentation and detection largely extend the object categories. In this talk, I will introduce a few works that have been done in my group along this line, showing the trends from close-set to open-set and to open-world.
