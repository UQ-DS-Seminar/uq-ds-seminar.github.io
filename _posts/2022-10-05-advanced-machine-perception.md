Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have impacted on our lives profoundly, such as providing more secured and resilient social environments and assisting more accurate medical diagnosis. As machine perception is one of the most fundamental and important components in computer vision and machine learning pipelines, achieving accurate and robust machine perception abilities in various situations plays a critical role in modern AI systems.

In this talk, I will present our recent research results on machine perception algorithms in surveillance systems as well as in AI assisted medical diagnosis. In particular, I will introduce our face hallucination methods that significantly improve the perception ability of surveillance systems, thus ensuring the security of our society or facilitating forensics. I will also present our developed advanced brain tumor diagnosis algorithms to address the problems of limited medical data or missing medical data which often happen in real-world clinical practice, while improving the perception ability in AI assisted medical diagnosis systems.
