Building experiments doesnâ€™t just end once the model is deployed. Teams need to monitor their models in production and use their findings to iterate further. Especially when dealing with tens to hundreds of models you need to monitor and automate at scale! How do you track your experiments? Have you ever found it hard to reproduce them and is sharing results with your colleagues and managers a headache?
Join us on May 10, at 1 PM AEST to learn all about experiment tracking at scale with Pachyderm and Weights & Biases. W&B introduction and product walkthrough (talk will touch on: experiment tracking, W&B Tables, Sweeps,  Artifacts, Dashboards/Reports, Integrations), followed by a Colab classification competition in Kaggle with swag for top submissions
